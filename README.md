#Remarks

29/12/2024: I am absolutely floored at how easy this project is to handle.
I came in today tired and sleepy, dreading the fact that I
would need to do a lot of heavy lifting to separate the
editBar and the main content. That, and the fact that I'd
have to add in styles.

It took me less than 15 minutes to get half of that work
done. React makes it so simple it's insane.

Something that would have taken me ages to write out specific
classes for containers, and finding them in the endless void
of const labelContainer = document.createElement("div").

React is a pleasure to work with.

However, this is half the battle - the second half (both
literally and figuratively), begins with the actual
CV content and making it editable
